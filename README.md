### Description
Make Art with AI is an introductory course for students with no prior knowledge to explore and utilize machine learning models. Students will explore diverse and experimental methods in Machine Learning such as image classification, pose estimation, body segmentation, pitch detection and k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN). Working with a variety of pre-trained models and techniques, they will produce artistic, innovative and interactive projects on web platforms. Both practical and creative applications are to be investigated as students will be encouraged to design their own experiences and solutions.

 
### Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
* recognize and expand their knowledge and experience in Machine Learning (ML), utilizing ML models in ml5.js;
* review and practice the fundamentals of programming, especially Object-Oriented Programming and integrate the concepts into practical applications;
* categorize ML models, and visualize and simulate the various data from the models, which can be identifiable, manageable and reusable;
* apply diverse computational techniques with ML models to their own ideas and practices;
* create artistic, innovative, practical and/or interactive artifacts on the web platform with machine learning models, and;
* produce, demonstrate and evaluate generative art and/or creative applications by utilizing a combination of concepts and techniques discussed over the course.

### Structure & Teaching Methodology
Learning and teaching Machine Learning can be a daunting task. This class seeks to reverse the conventional methods of teaching Machine Learning by applying a more friendly and approachable style, masking the complexity of the concepts and technologies. Students will review the fundamentals of programming first. Then they will use existing machine learning models (pre-trained) and apply them to their own ideas and outputs, similar to the way we utilize physical sensors with Arudino or devices such as Leap Motion and Kinect without a full understanding of its construction or blueprint.

The courses will progress with three hands-on workshop style sessions and one presentation/sharing session. By the end of the course, on the presentation/sharing day, students will have completed and present their main project. Diverse techniques and applications of ML models will be demonstrated during weekly synchronous sessions. The instructor will facilitate programming concepts and techniques in live-coding. Students will be  encouraged to actively follow the code along with the instructor, ask questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion.

Students will be also encouraged to reach out to the instructor outside of class, and ask questions, share ideas/feedback and discuss the topics and techniques in detail.
